      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Hello and welcome to my portfolio.
      
      The frontend was built using React and Redux combined with Semantic UI styling components. The backend was built using Node, Mongoose, Passport and Plivo.  Feel free to poke around.

      PS. There are Easter eggs throughout the site accessible by entering the Konami code. Enjoy!
